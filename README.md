<h3><b>Hi there, I'm Amro Sati </b><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="30"></h3>
A dedicated software engineer with a strong foundation in problem-solving and a passion for crafting innovative solutions.

My journey began with a deep interest in *software engineering*. Through rigorous problem-solving exercises and real-world projects, I've honed my analytical and problem-solving skills.
This foundation has equipped me to tackle complex challenges and deliver effective solutions.

While exploring the world of software development, I discovered a passion for creating tangible products that solve real-world problems.
This led me to join the [**ALX**](https://www.alxafrica.com/) Software Engineering Program, where I've embraced a project-based learning approach to sharpen my technical skills and practical knowledge.

I'm constantly driven to learn and grow, exploring new technologies and frameworks to stay ahead of the curve.
Building projects has been instrumental in my development, allowing me to apply theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios and gain hands-on experience.

Currently, I'm honing my skills as a full-stack software engineer through the **ALX SE** *Program*.
I'm eager to collaborate with talented individuals and contribute to open-source projects to make a positive impact on the *developer community*.
